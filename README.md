# BMW-Car-Sales-Classification
This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts BMW car sales classification (High/Low) based on various features such as model, year, region, color, fuel type, transmission, engine size, mileage, price, and sales volume. The machine learning model was trained using PyCaret-trained model (`tuned_svm_model.pkl`) and deployed in this interactive app for easy use.
