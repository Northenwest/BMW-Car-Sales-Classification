# BMW-Car-Sales-Classification
This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts BMW car sales classification (High/Low) based on various features such as model, year, region, color, fuel type, transmission, engine size, mileage, price, and sales volume. The machine learning model was trained using PyCaret and deployed in this interactive app for easy use.
